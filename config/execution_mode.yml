# Pipeline Execution Configuration
# Controls how the pipeline orchestrator handles errors

execution:
  # Mode: "autonomous" or "human-in-loop"
  # - autonomous: Agent auto-fixes errors and retries without user approval
  # - human-in-loop: Agent proposes fixes and waits for user approval
  mode: human-in-loop

retry:
  # Maximum number of retry attempts after a failure
  max_retries: 3

  # Base delay in seconds between retries (exponential backoff applied)
  base_delay_seconds: 5

  # Backoff multiplier (delay = base * multiplier^attempt)
  backoff_multiplier: 2

autonomous:
  # Minimum confidence score (0-1) required to auto-apply a fix
  # Fixes below this threshold fall back to human-in-loop
  min_confidence: 0.8

  # Create backup before applying fixes
  create_backups: true

logging:
  # Log file paths (relative to project root)
  pipeline_runs: logs/pipeline_runs.log
  errors: logs/errors.log
  fixes: logs/fixes.log

  # Log format: "simple" or "json"
  format: simple
