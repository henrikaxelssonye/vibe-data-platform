# Sample Skill

## Quick workflow

1) Confirm the desired output type (note, checklist, or summary) and the intended audience.
2) Ask for any missing inputs (topic, constraints, length, tone) in one short question.
3) Produce the output in plain Markdown with a clear title and tight structure.

## Output format

- For a note: 1 title + 2-4 short paragraphs.
- For a checklist: 1 title + 4-8 checkbox items.
- For a summary: 1 title + 3-5 bullets.

## Example triggers

- "Draft a short note to announce a maintenance window."
- "Summarize these meeting notes in 4 bullets."
- "Create a quick deployment checklist."
